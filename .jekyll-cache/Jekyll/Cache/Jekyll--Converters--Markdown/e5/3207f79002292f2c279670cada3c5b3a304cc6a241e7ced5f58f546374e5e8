<p>I am set on continuously expanding her technical and interpersonal skills. I determined to turn my passion for software and tech into a long-lasting and successful career.</p>

<p>I have never been afraid of stepping out of her comfort zone to experience new things when it comes to her career or personal life. This mindset has allowed her to switch career from Test Analyst to DevOps Consultant by learning new skills like Python, Linux, and Virtualisation. I have gained experience in Agile methodology and exposed to various Software Development tools like Jenkins, Github and Flask.</p>

<p>I like to watch comedy movies with my family and likes to cook for friends and family at my leisure time.</p>

<p>Test Analyst, Since April 2020</p>

<p>In May 2021, I quit what I thought was once my dream job.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Until I exposed to Devops tools,</p>

<p>Furthermore, I saw that Generation Z‚Äîthe generation with the greatest potential to reimagine and rebuild systems vital to human flourishing‚Äîwas not getting the support it needed to unleash it.</p>

<p>I knew that needed to change.</p>

<p>While I had long contemplated breaking what are infamously called Google‚Äôs ‚Äúgolden handcuffs,‚Äù it was meeting my eventual Civics Unplugged co-founders that finally gave me the courage to quit my job. They reminded me of something very important.</p>

<p>This is a make or break decade for humanity.</p>

<p>If we don‚Äôt quickly do what is need to train a new generation of leaders committed to universal human flourishing, humanity will sink under the weight of its greatest challenges‚Äîincluding the climate crisis, skyrocketing inequality, and rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

<p>So how does Civics Unplugged fit into the human flourishing equation? CU helps channel Gen Z‚Äôs passion, creativity, and idealism toward building a brighter future for humanity. Over the course of the decade, CU will empower tens of thousands of Gen Z leaders to devote themselves to the cause and inspire millions more supporters.</p>

<p>While we are only on year two of our decade-long journey, we are off to a strong start, with partners and supporters like Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson, Andrew Yang, Ethereum Foundation, and the Smithsonian‚Äîwho have committed to doing whatever it takes to help our Gen Zers create lasting change and build a brighter future for us all.</p>

<p>Google Cloud</p>

<p>Software Engineer Tech Lead, Fall 2015 - May 2019</p>

<p>New York, NY</p>

<p>Landing a job at Google was a dream come true. I more or less worked all of college to get to that point.</p>

<p>While I still suffer from imposter syndrome to this day, I quickly convinced others I deserved to be there and was given a lot of responsibility at a young age.</p>

<p>The team I had the privilege of helping lead was tasked with improving the user experience for Google Cloud users. We helped carry out the top-to-bottom redesign and implementation of Cloud Datastore‚Äôs UI, and then led the front-end team of Google‚Äôs Cloud SQL product. March 2017, we launched our PostgreSQL offering ‚Äì which increased Cloud SQL‚Äôs total addressable market by ~40%. April 2019, we launched our initial SQL Server offering - which is poised to increase Cloud SQL‚Äôs total addressable market by ~$6B.</p>

<p>I wouldn‚Äôt trade my tenure at Google for anything. I was able to ship products that bettered the lives of millions of people around the world. But ultimately, I knew I couldn‚Äôt stay there long-term. Civics Unplugged was calling.</p>
